Py-Message Documentation
=============================================================================================================

Py-Message is a lightweight package enabling sending messages from Python using email, simple-message-service (SMS),
and an application for messaging, Pushover. Pushover is the easiest to get set up. Email, especially if using GMail,
is a close second. Finally, although extremely convenient once set up, SMS requires the most effort to get up and
running. The upside is SMS will work with any mobile device, even a 1992 Nokia brick.
